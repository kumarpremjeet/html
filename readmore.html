<h2>Datails about HTML :</h2>

<p align="justify" >
    The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for
     documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by 
     technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

     Web browsers receive HTML documents
 from a web server or from local storage and render the documents 
    into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page
  semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
  &lt; img &gt; <br>
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images 
and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. 
HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics 
for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
 links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using 
 angle brackets. Tags such as &lt; img  &gt;  and directly introduce 
 content into the page. Other tags such as &lt; p &gt; <br> surround and provide information
      about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not 
      display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which 
affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout 
of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current 
maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2]
&lt;/p&gt;
<h2>Features for Html</h2>
<ol>
Html is a static page. <br>
Html is not a case sensitive. <br>
Html is a error free language. <br>
Html is simple and easy language. <br>
It provides facilities to add audio, video, image on web pages. <br>
Html is platform independent language, it can be run on any platform like window, linux, Mac. <br>
Each and every elements of html should be enclosed within the angular brackets (< >). <br>
Html programs are executed by the interpreter of the browser software. <br>
Html program save with .htm or .html extension. <br>
The current version of Html is Html 5.0 <br>

<h3>History of html</h3>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p align="justify">
    In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system
     for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet
     -based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late
      1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint
       request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4] from 
       1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.

    The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on 
    the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, 
    relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid
    , an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of
     these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]
    
    HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material 
    into visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in
     the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional 
     use of CSS. Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for
      using SGML, which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by
       the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating
        system: these formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format
         documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges
          with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup;
           HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.
    
    Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the Internet 
    Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML 
    specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan 
    Connolly, which included an SGML Document type definition to define the grammar.[9][10] The 
    draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic
     browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of 
     basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet-Draft, 
     "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented
      features like tables and fill-out forms.[11]
    
    After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group, which in 
    1995 completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against 
    which future implementations should be based.[12]
    
    Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, 
    the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the
     World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).[13] However, in 2000, HTML also became an international standard 
     (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through
      2001. In 2004, development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group
       (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and completed and standardized on
        28 October 2014.[14]

<h2>Datails about CSS :</h2>
<p align="justify" >
    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
    
    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
    
    The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
    
    The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]
    
    In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.

<h3>CSS Selector :</h3>
<p align="justify">
    In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and
     attributes in the markup itself. <br>

<b> Selectors may apply to the following:</b> <br>

all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2
elements specified by attribute, in particular: <br>
id: an identifier unique within the document, identified with a hash prefix  <br>
e.g. #id <br>
class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document, identified with a period prefix<br>
 e.g. .classname <br>
elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.
Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters, hyphens,
 and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any elements.
  An ID may only be applied to a single element.

Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not
 contained in the document tree. One example of a widely used pseudo-class is :hover, which identifies 
 content only when the user "points to" the visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it.
  It is appended to a selector as in a:hover or #elementid:hover. A pseudo-class classifies document elements,
   such as :link or :visited, whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection that may consist of partial elements,
    such as ::first-line or ::first-letter.[6]

Selectors may be combined in many ways to achieve great specificity and flexibility.[7] Multiple selectors may 
be joined in a spaced list to specify elements by location, element type, id, class, or any combination thereof. The order of the selectors is important. For example, div .myClass {color: red;} applies to all elements of class myClass that are inside div elements, whereas .myClass div {color: red;} applies to all div elements that are inside elements of class myClass. This is not to be confused with concatenated identifiers such as div.myClass {color: red;} which applies to div elements of class myClass.

The following table provides a summary of selector syntax indicating usage and the version of CSS that introduced
it.[8]

  <b> Brendan Eich</b> (/ˈaɪk/; born July 4, 1961)[1] is an American computer programmer and technology executive. 
  He created the JavaScript programming language and co-founded the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation,
   and the Mozilla Corporation. He served as the Mozilla Corporation's chief technical officer before he was 
   appointed chief executive officer, but resigned shortly after his appointment due to controversy over his 
   opposition to same-sex marriage. He subsequently became the CEO of Brave Software.

<h3>Netscape and JavaScript:</h3>
<p align="justify"> 
  Eich started work at Netscape Communications Corporation in April 1995. 
  Eich originally joined intending to put Scheme "in the browser",[4] but his Netscape 
  superiors insisted that the language's syntax resemble that of Java. As a result, Eich devised 
  a language that had much of the functionality of Scheme, the object-orientation of Self, and the
   syntax of Java. He completed the first version in ten days in order to accommodate the Navigator
    2.0 Beta release schedule,[4][5] and was called Mocha, but renamed LiveScript in September 1995 and 
    finally in a joint announcement with Sun Microsystem it was named JavaScript in December.[6] Simultaneously,
     he designed the first SpiderMonkey engine for the Netscape Navigator browser at Netscape Communications.
      When Mozilla inherited the Netscape base code in 1998, it included this engine, which was written
       in the C programming language.[7] It was then changed in JavaScript 1. 5 to comply with the
        ECMA-262 standard.[citation needed] Eich continued to oversee the development of SpiderMonkey,
         the specific implementation of JavaScript in Navigator.[7]
